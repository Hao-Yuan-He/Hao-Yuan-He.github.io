# Personal Page (Static, No Jekyll)

This repository now serves a lightweight personal website built with plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Active Site

- Source: `lite-site/`
- Entry: `lite-site/index.html`
- Publications are parsed from: `lite-site/data/papers.bib`
- Citation styles supported in UI: `IEEE`, `APA`, `MLA`

## Local Development

```bash
cd lite-site
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Open `http://localhost:8080`.

## Legacy Jekyll Backup

The previous Jekyll-based site was fully archived and preserved in:

- `legacy-jekyll/`

This keeps all old content and templates available if you want to rebuild or migrate parts later.
