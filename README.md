# Personal Page (Static, No Jekyll)

This repository now serves a lightweight personal website built with plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Active Site

- Source: `lite-site/`
- Entry: `lite-site/index.html`
- Publications are parsed from: `lite-site/data/papers.bib`
- Citation styles supported in UI: `IEEE`, `APA`, `MLA`

## Local Development

```bash
cd lite-site
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Open `http://localhost:8080`.

## Notes

The old Jekyll version has been removed to keep this repository focused on the lightweight static site in `lite-site/`.
