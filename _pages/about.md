I am a first year Ph.D. student of [School of Artificial Intelligence in Nanjing University](https://ai.nju.edu.cn/) and a member of [LAMDA Group](https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn), which is led by professor Zhi-Hua Zhou.
I received my B.Sc. degree from [School of Computer Science of Nanjing Tech University](https://cise.njtech.edu.cn/). 
In September 2021, I was admitted to study for a M.Sc. degree in Nanjing University.
I am now going to study for a Ph.D. degree in June 2023.

**Research Interests**. I am interested in topics in machine learning, especially in the following aspects.
- *Weakly supervised learning*. <a style="font-size:0.95rem;">Learning under incomplete, inexact, or incorrect supervision.</a>
- *Abductive learning*.  <a style="font-size:0.95rem;">How to integrate machine learning (System I) and logical reasoning (System II) seamlessly to build up the next-generation artificial intelligence system.</a>
