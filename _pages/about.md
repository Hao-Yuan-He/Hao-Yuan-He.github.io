I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the [School of Artificial Intelligence, Nanjing University](https://ai.nju.edu.cn/), and a proud member of the [LAMDA Group](https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn) led by Professor Zhi-Hua Zhou. I earned my B.Sc. degree from the [School of Computer Science, Nanjing Tech University](https://cise.njtech.edu.cn/). In September 2021, I began my M.Sc. studies at Nanjing University, and I am now continuing towards my Ph.D., start from December 2024. I am always open to potential collaborations. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested.

**Research Interests**. My research interests lie in the field of machine learning, with a particular focus on:
- Weakly Supervised Learning: Learning under incomplete, inexact, or incorrect supervision.
- Abductive Learning: Integrating machine learning with logical reasoning.
