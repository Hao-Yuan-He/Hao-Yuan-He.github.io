I am a third year graduate student of [School of Artificial Intelligence in Nanjing University](https://ai.nju.edu.cn/) and a member of [LAMDA Group](https://www.lamda.nju.edu.cn), which is led by professor Zhi-Hua Zhou.
I received my B.Sc. degree from [School of Computer Science of Nanjing Tech University](https://cise.njtech.edu.cn/). In September 2021, I was admitted to study for a M.Sc. degree in Nanjing University.

Research Interests. I am interested in topics in machine learning, especially in the following aspects.
- **Weakly supervised learning**: learning under incomplete, inexact, or incorrect supervision.
- **Abductive learning**: seamless combination of logical reasoning and machine learning.
